# Covid-19 Automata Simulator

## Introduction

In the last few years, COVID19 has affected the lives of every person in a large way. Our goal with this project is to provide visualization to further understand the consequences of the deadly pandemic. We want to do this through a cellular automata model and plan on extending the model to be more realistic and representative of the real world, if time permits.
