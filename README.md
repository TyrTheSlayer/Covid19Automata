# Covid-19 Automata Simulator

## Introduction

In the last few years, COVID19 has affected the lives of every person in a large way. Our goal with this project is to provide visualization to further understand the consequences of the deadly pandemic. We want to do this through a cellular automata model and plan on extending the model to be more realistic and representative of the real world, if time permits.

## Contents

* diagrams: Contains all UML and assorted diagrams for the project. Broken down into different versions as code changes/improvements were made
* project: Contains the general project code and subsequent modules
        *UI: Holds the UI implementation for initial menu, running/interacting with the simulation, and post simulation graph interaction
                *UI.java: intial menu
                *MainFrame.java: During simulation UI, can change speed of running and exit to post simulation
                *PostSimUI.java: User interface after simulation
        *Simulator: 
                *BehaviorAgent.java: Handles intelligent behaviors of the automata, such as intent and direction for user movement
                *DataOut.java: handles the data output to a csv for graph creation for the post simulation
                *Factor.java: handles the factors influencing infection like age, vaccination, mask
                *Intent.java: handles status/actions for a cell and stores data to be used by the BehaviorAgent
                *SimSettings.java: Holds and sets the settings changed by the user at the initial menu
        *Path: only holds Path.java, implements the logic for intelligent pathing for people
        *Grid: Holds logic for all objects on the grid
                *Building.java: Class that represents a building, implements logic for the different buildings
                *BuildingType.java: Basic enum to track the building types
                *GridPanel.java: creates the grid the mainframe will display to the user
                *Tile.java: implements the logic for the tiles in the simulation
        *DataObjects:
                *DailySchedule.java: class defining logic for users on where they go and how, increases intelligent movement
                *Person.java: person object that keeps track of all of the data for the people. 
                *Status.java: the status enum for people, determining infeciton and death status
                *TimeCard.java: data storage for a scheduled obligation a person might have
                *Virus.java: object used to represent the instance of a virus
                *VirusStage.java: enum for the stage of a virus, incubating, contagious, fatal etc.
                *VirusType.java: logic for the virus type, giving details of contagious time and such. 
* reports: Contains the reports required for the CSE326 Software Engineering course
